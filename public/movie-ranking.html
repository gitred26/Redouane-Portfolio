        <h3>1. Peaky Blinders</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This is my top-of-the-list Series so far; each episode I watch ignites my thirst for success</li>
            <li>My second reason for being in love with this piece of art is the British accent</li>
            <li>My third reason is a poem I heard Thomes Shelby recite: <em>"A Poison Tree"</em> by William Blake</li>
        </ol> 
        <h4>Here are a few lines I never forget:</h4>
        <p id="italics">
            I was angry with my friend; <br>
            I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>
            I was angry with my foe: <br>
            I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>2. Harry Potter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless I came across Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter would be my favourite in the list</li>
            <li>Harry Potter is my top movie series so far;</li>
            <li>if you ask me "how many time have you watch it?", I would say <strong>"YES!"</strong></li>
            <li>Every time I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood experiences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Well! I can feel that look in you haha!! I am into series or movie series, <strong>NO IDEA WHYYY!</strong></li>
            <li>My best reason for loving this film is of course Jack Sparrow haha!!</li>
