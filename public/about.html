    <h2>Education:</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      My educational journey has been a thrilling expedition through the realms of academia. 
      It all began with my high school years, where I delved into the world of letters, 
      cultivating a love for language and literature.
    </p>
    <P class="paragraph">
      After a quite difficult start in 2016, I embarked on my bachelor's degree in English Studies, specializing in Linguistics. 
      This period of study was foundational, laying the groundwork for my fascination with the intricacies of language and communication.
    </P>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Eager to delve deeper into the field, in 2020 I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics, 
      where I explored the practical applications of linguistic theory in real-world contexts.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Building upon this foundation, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Business Administration (MBA), blending my linguistic expertise with business acumen.
      Also my other reasons for choosing to pursue an MBA came from my interest in building an IT business in the future.
      Speaking of Computer science and IT world, I am a self-taught developer in the my starting-point on the field.
